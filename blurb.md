# Where Am I? [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/McCoyGroup/Binder-McUtils/master?urlpath=git-pull%3Frepo%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252FMcCoyGroup%252FPsience%26urlpath%3Dlab%252Ftree%252FPsience%252Fbinder%252Findex.ipynb%26branch%3Dmaster)

This is the reference documentation for the [`Psience`](https://github.com/McCoyGroup/Psience) package, 
written starting in 2018 by the McCoy group at the University of Washington.

The package is split into a two major subsections, focused on two methodologies for solving the time-independent vibrational Schr√∂dinger equation.
The first is the `DVR` subpackage which supports constructing _discrete variable representations_. This provides exact results but is suitable only
for low-dimensional problems (up to 4 in general).

The second is the `VPT2` package which provides functionality for running vibrational-perturbation theory. It is most optimized for second-order vibrational
perturbation theory but supports arbitrary order perturbation theory.

There are also core helper packages, most notably `Molecools`, that support these methodologies. A large swath of functionality is provided and [we'd like your help knowing where to focus our documentation efforts](https://github.com/McCoyGroup/Psience/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=documentation-suggestion.md&title=Documentation+Suggestion)

You can read more about the functionality provided in the [API reference](Psience).
The reference is automatically generated by the [Peeves](https://github.com/McCoyGroup/Peeves) testing/documentation helper package.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get the package is through `pip`

```lang-shell
python -m pip install mccoygroup-psience
```

We've put some examples in a JupyterLab notebook (`root/binder/index.ipynb`) that you can launch with Binder or run locally, too.

It is probably best to start by adapting the examples on each reference page for your use cases and then build from there.

Let us know what you want to use `Psience` for so we can get started helping you get started!
