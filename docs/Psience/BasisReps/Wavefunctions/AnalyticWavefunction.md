## <a id="Psience.BasisReps.Wavefunctions.AnalyticWavefunction">AnalyticWavefunction</a>
Little extension to RepresentationBasis so that we can use p and x and stuff
to evaluate out matrix elements and stuff.
This will be more progressively more tightly meshed with RepresentationBasis in the future,
but for now I just want to provide the scaffolding so that I can build off of it.
