## <a id="Psience.BasisReps.StateIndexers.PermutationStateIndexer">PermutationStateIndexer</a>
A sophisticated indexer that takes a state dimension and provides
indices based on the `shortlex` ordering, where ordering is defined
first by # of quanta of excitation, then by which partitioning of the #quanta,
 it represents, and finally by which permutation of that paritioning it is.
Is likely about as stable as an indexer can be expected to be over large
numbers of states. Unlikely to exhaust the max integers available for most
systems.
