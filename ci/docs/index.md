# Where Am I?

This is the reference documentation for the [`Psience`](https://github.com/McCoyGroup/Psience) package, 
written starting in 2018 by the McCoy group at the University of Washington.

The package is split into a two major subsections, focused on two methodologies for solving the time-independent vibrational Schr√∂dinger equation.
The first is the `DVR` subpackage which supports constructing _discrete variable representations_. This provides exact results but is suitable only
for low-dimensional problems (up to 4 in general).

The second is the `VPT2` package which provides functionality for running vibrational-perturbation theory. It is most optimized for second-order vibrational
perturbation theory but supports arbitrary order perturbation theory.

You can read more about the functionality provided in the [API reference](Psience).
The reference is automatically generated by the [Peeves](https://github.com/McCoyGroup/Peeves) testing/documentation helper package.

## Getting Started

Let us know what you want to use `Psience` for so we can get started helping you get started!

### Help Us Out!

Each page _should_ support examples, but unfortunately most do not, simply because writing that kind of thing by hand is time consuming.
If you see a page without examples, help us out!
Even though these pages are automatically generated, you can add examples to them by putting a file in the appropriate _examples_ slot and rebuilding the docs by simply making a commit.
Similarly, if you see something that you think should be improved, you can either edit the docstrings in the source or let us know about the deficiency here [issues](https://github.com/McCoyGroup/Psience/issues/new?title=Documentation%20Improvement%20Needed).

##### Examples

To contribute an example for a page at 

```
https://mccoygroup.github.io/Psience/Molecools/Molecule.html
```

you'll either add the appropriate file by going to 

```
https://github.com/McCoyGroup/Psience/new/edit?filename=ci/docs/examples/Molecools/Molecule.md
```

or edit the existing one by going to 

```
https://github.com/McCoyGroup/Psience/edit/edit/ci/docs/examples/Molecools/Molecule.md
```

##### Documentation

For this, you'll need to navigate to the appropriate package. The breadcrumbs on the documentation pages can be very helpful for this. 
Say you wanted to edit some docstring on the `Molecule` class.
To do so you'd first note that in the breadcrumb we have

```lang-none
Psience / Molecools
```

So you'd go to [https://github.com/McCoyGroup/Psience/Molecools](https://github.com/McCoyGroup/Psience/Molecools) & then notice that there is a package called `Molecule.py`.
Then, clicking on the package's edit link ( [McCoyGroup/Psience/edit/edit/Molecools/Molecule.py](https://github.com/McCoyGroup/Psience/edit/edit/Molecools/Molecule.py) ) you can navigate to where `Molecule` is defined and edit that.
Alternately, if you know the line number in the source file, you can link directly to that line in the source and then people can use the GitHub UI.

After editing, you'll need to rerun the site build via the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/McCoyGroup/Psience/actions?query=workflow%3A%22McBuild+site%22) we set up.

##### Templates

The documentation build makes use of a template system to generate its Markdown pages.
In particular, it uses the files [here](https://github.com/McCoyGroup/Psience/tree/edit/ci/docs/templates) to make this work, where the following hierarchy is used:
* `index.md` is used for this main index page
* `module.md` is used for modules
* `class.md` is used for classes
* `function.md` is used for stand-alone functions
* `method.md` is used for object methods
* `object.md` is used for objects with a `__name__` parameter

You can also add custom templates for pages, if you feel they need more information than the auto-generator can provide.
To do so, we'll add to the file path in the [templates](https://github.com/McCoyGroup/Psience/tree/edit/docs/templates) directory of the documentation.

For the `McUtils.GaussianInterface` example from before, to edit the template we would have

```
https://github.com/McCoyGroup/References/edit/gh-pages/Documentation/templates/McUtils/GaussianInterface.md
```

and or to make the file we'd use 

```
https://github.com/McCoyGroup/References/new/gh-pages?filename=Documentation/templates/McUtils/GaussianInterface.md
```

once `Peeves` has a chance to rebuild the site, the new template will be used.

It's generally good to build off of the old templates, though, so that we don't lose information.
